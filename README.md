## Description

This is a Christmas card that I made for my family. It is a simple web page that uses JavaScript to draw a Christmas tree and snowflakes on a canvas. The snowflakes fall down the screen and the tree lights up. The snowflakes are drawn using a random number of points and a random radius. The tree is drawn using a random number of branches and a random branch length. The tree lights up by changing the color of the lights every second.
